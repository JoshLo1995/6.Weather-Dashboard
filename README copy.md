# Day Planner
This is the fifth assignment for the UW Coding Bootcamp Winter 2019. The uploaded site is a page that allows the user to plan their 9am - 5pm work day. In the center are text fields where the user can enter tasks that need to be completed. A save button is located to the right to allow the user to come back to the program.

## Getting Started
Download the repository and begin by opening the index.html file.
